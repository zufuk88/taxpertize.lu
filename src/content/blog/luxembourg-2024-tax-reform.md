The Luxembourg government has announced significant changes to its tax framework for 2024, marking one of the most comprehensive reforms in recent years. These changes will have far-reaching implications for international businesses operating in the Grand Duchy.

## Key Highlights of the Reform

The 2024 tax reform introduces several pivotal changes designed to maintain Luxembourg's competitive edge while ensuring compliance with international standards:

### Corporate Tax Rate Adjustments

The reform maintains Luxembourg's competitive corporate tax rates while introducing new brackets for large multinational enterprises. Companies with revenues exceeding â‚¬750 million will face additional reporting requirements aligned with OECD Pillar Two recommendations.

### Digital Services Tax Implementation

A new digital services tax targeting tech giants will come into effect, applying a 3% levy on digital revenues generated within Luxembourg. This aligns with EU-wide efforts to ensure fair taxation of digital economy participants.

## Impact on Investment Funds

Investment funds, particularly AIFs and UCITS structures, will benefit from enhanced tax neutrality provisions. The reform introduces:

- Streamlined withholding tax procedures for fund distributions
- Extended exemptions for carried interest arrangements
- New incentives for sustainable investment strategies

## Substance Requirements Enhancement

Following ATAD 3 directives, the reform strengthens substance requirements for Luxembourg entities:

1. **Minimum Local Presence**: Companies must demonstrate genuine economic activity
2. **Board Composition**: At least one Luxembourg-resident director required
3. **Decision-Making**: Key strategic decisions must occur within Luxembourg

## Transfer Pricing Updates

The reform aligns Luxembourg's transfer pricing rules more closely with OECD guidelines:

- Mandatory country-by-country reporting for all large multinationals
- Enhanced documentation requirements for related-party transactions
- Introduction of advance pricing agreement fast-track procedures

## Green Finance Incentives

Luxembourg continues to position itself as a sustainable finance hub with new tax incentives:

- Reduced tax rates for certified green bonds
- Accelerated depreciation for ESG-compliant investments
- Tax credits for companies achieving sustainability targets

## Practical Implications

International businesses should begin preparing for these changes immediately:

### Immediate Actions Required

- Review existing Luxembourg structures for compliance
- Update transfer pricing documentation
- Assess substance requirements against new standards
- Consider restructuring opportunities before implementation

### Long-term Strategic Considerations

The reform presents both challenges and opportunities. While compliance costs may increase, the enhanced certainty and new incentives could make Luxembourg even more attractive for certain activities.

## Conclusion

Luxembourg's 2024 tax reform demonstrates the country's commitment to remaining a premier international business hub while adapting to global tax developments. Companies that proactively address these changes will be best positioned to benefit from Luxembourg's evolving tax landscape.
